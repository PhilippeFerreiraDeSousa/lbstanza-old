This branch is for developing the Conan package manager integration
using Stanza's 'foreign package manager' API.

How to run:

    cd tests
    stanza repl stz-test-suite/dev-package-manager

It should print out:

    Begin test of package manager.
    Retrieve the configuration parameters.
    Retrieved params:
      FieldType:
        field-name: project-root
        optional?: false
        field-type: ValueType(atom-type = StringType, single? = true)
        field-context: PathField
      FieldType:
        field-name: email
        optional?: true
        field-type: ValueType(atom-type = StringType, single? = true)
        field-context: StandardField
    Retrieve the .proj variables that the package manager supplies.
    The package manager provides these variables:
      CONAN-BUILD-DIR: "mytempdrive/build/mydir/myproject/.conan/build"
      CONAN-INCLUDES: ("-lCONAN" "-lCONANHOME")
    Based upon the params retrieve the additional dependencies from the package manager:
    The package manager introduces dependencies:
      ccfiles: []
      ccflags: ["-L@buildargs"]
    Suppose that dependencies have now been calculated.
    Request the package manager to satisfy the following dependencies.
      packages = ["gzip/11.2.3" "simlib/v2" "jitx/0.0.13-rc1"]
    SYSTEM: call-system(["conan" "--init" "--root" "mytempdrive/build/mydir/myproject"])
    SYSTEM: call-system(["conan" "update" "gzip/11.2.3"])
    SYSTEM: call-system(["conan" "update" "simlib/v2"])
    SYSTEM: call-system(["conan" "update" "jitx/0.0.13-rc1"])

What to implement:

    compiler/conan-package-manager.stanza: This file contains the main implementation
    of the conan package manager integration. Some example stubs are provided.

    tests/dev-package-manager.stanza: This file contains a test harness that
    pokes and drives the conan package manager. You will have to modify this
    harness to poke the package manager in the desired way.

Details:

    This is an initial API proposal for the foreign package manager.
    Please let me know if there are additional hooks that are needed.

    The package manager is provided a System object for performing a
    small number of operations with the system. Let me know if this
    needs to be extended.
